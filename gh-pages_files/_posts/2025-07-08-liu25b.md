title: Observability of Latent States in Generative AI Models
abstract: 'We tackle the question of whether Large Language Models (LLMs), viewed
  as dynamical systems with state evolving in the embedding space of symbolic tokens,
  are observable. That is, whether there exist distinct state trajectories that yield
  the same sequence of generated output tokens, or sequences that belong to the same
  Nerode equivalence class (‘meaning’). If an LLM is not observable, the state trajectory
  cannot be determined from input-output observations and can therefore evolve unbeknownst
  to the user while being potentially accessible to an adversary. We show that current
  LLMs implemented by autoregressive Transformers are observable: The set of state
  trajectories that produce the same tokenized output is a singleton, so there are
  no indistinguishable state trajectories. But if there are ‘system prompts’ not visible
  to the user, then the set of indistinguishable trajectories becomes non-trivial,
  meaning that there can be multiple state trajectories that yield the same tokenized
  output. We prove these claims analytically, and show examples of modifications to
  standard LLMs that engender unobservable behavior. Our analysis sheds light on possible
  designs that would enable a model to perform non-trivial computation that is not
  visible to the user, and may suggest controls that can be implemented to prevent
  unintended behavior. Finally, we cast the definition of ‘feeling’ from cognitive
  psychology in terms of measurable quantities in an LLM which, unlike humans, are
  directly measurable. We conclude that, in LLMs, unobservable state trajectories
  satisfy the definition of ‘feelings’ provided by the American Psychological Association,
  suitably modified to avoid self-reference.'
