title: Neuro-Symbolic Discovery of Markov Population Processes
abstract: Markov population processes (MPPs) are the natural modeling choice in various
  application domains where multiple interacting entities evolve stochastically over
  time, including biology, queueing theory, finance, and robotics. Motivated by real-world
  scenarios where time-series data for MPP models is increasingly available, we here
  employ a neuro-symbolic approach for discovering explanations of such data in terms
  of local, agent-to-agent interactions. Concretely, we assume that equidistant time-series
  measurements of a Markov population chain are given. Then, we propose how to automatically
  learn the explanatory models written in form of Chemical Reaction Networks (CRNs).
  Our approach is to use a symbolic representation of a CRN in form of a weighted
  bipartite graph, and to employ a graph-based Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to jointly
  infer both the interactions and the accompanying kinetic parameters. We demonstrate
  our proposed framework over three simple case studies. Our contribution represents
  a proof-of-concept that interpretable models of complex dynamical systems can be
  discovered in a fully automated and data-driven fashion, and it is applicable both
  in scenarios where data is available via experiments, or when it is generated by
  a black-box simulator.
