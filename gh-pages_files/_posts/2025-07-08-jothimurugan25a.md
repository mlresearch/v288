title: Specification-Guided Reinforcement Learning
abstract: This tutorial explores specification-guided reinforcement learning as an
  alternative to traditional reward-based approaches, where the design of effective
  reward functions can be tedious, error-prone, and may not capture complex objectives.
  We introduce formal logical specifications as a more intuitive and precise way to
  define agent behavior, focusing on the theoretical guarantees and algorithmic aspects
  of learning from specifications. We examine both fundamental limitations in infinite-horizon
  settings and practical approaches for finite-horizon specifications.
