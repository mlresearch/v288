title: Automaton-Based Representations of Task Knowledge from Generative Language
  Models
abstract: Automaton-based representations play an important role in control and planning
  for sequential decision-making problems. However, obtaining the high-level task
  knowledge required to build such automata is often difficult. Meanwhile, generated
  language models (GLMs) can automatically generate relevant text-based task knowledge.
  However, such text-based knowledge cannot be formally verified or used for sequential
  decision-making. We propose a novel algorithm named GLM2FSA that constructs a finite
  state automaton (FSA) encoding high-level task knowledge from a brief natural-language
  description of the task goal. GLM2FSA first sends queries to a GLM to extract task
  knowledge in textual form, and then it builds an FSA to represent this text-based
  knowledge. The proposed algorithm thus fills the gap between natural-language task
  descriptions and automaton-based representations, and the constructed FSAs can be
  formally verified against user-defined specifications. We accordingly propose a
  procedure to iteratively refine the input queries to the GLM based on the outcomes,
  e.g., counter-examples, from verification. We apply the proposed algorithm to an
  autonomous driving system to demonstrate its capability for sequential decision-making
  and formal verification. Furthermore, quantitative results indicate the refinement
  method improves the probability of generated knowledge satisfying the specifications
  by 40 percent.
