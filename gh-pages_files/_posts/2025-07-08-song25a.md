title: 'Lean Copilot: Large Language Models as Copilots for Theorem Proving in Lean'
abstract: Neural theorem proving combines large language models (LLMs) with proof
  assistants such as Lean, where the correctness of formal proofs can be rigorously
  verified, leaving no room for hallucination. With existing neural theorem provers
  pretrained on a fixed collection of data and offering valuable suggestions at times,
  it is challenging for them to continually prove novel theorems in a fully autonomous
  mode, where human insights may be critical. In this paper, we explore LLMs as copilots
  that assist humans in proving theorems. We introduce Lean Copilot, a general framework
  for running LLM inference natively in Lean. It enables programmers to build various
  LLM-based proof automation tools that integrate seamlessly into the workflow of
  Lean users. Lean users can use our pretrained models or bring their own ones that
  run either locally (with or without GPUs) or on the cloud. Using Lean Copilot, we
  build LLM-based tools that suggest proof steps, complete proof goals, and select
  relevant premises. Experimental results on the Mathematics in Lean textbook demonstrate
  the effectiveness of our method compared to existing rule-based proof automation
  in Lean (AESOP), confirming the significance of having LLMs integrated into the
  theorem proving workflow in Lean. When assisting humans, Lean Copilot requires only
  2.08 manually-entered proof steps on average (3.86 required by AESOP); when automating
  the theorem proving process, Lean Copilot automates 74.2% proof steps on average,
  85% better than AESOP (40.1%). We open source all code and artifacts under a permissive
  MIT license to facilitate further research.
