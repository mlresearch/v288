title: Provably Correct Automata Embeddings for Optimal Automata-Conditioned Reinforcement
  Learning
abstract: Automata-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL) has given promising results
  for learning multi-task policies capable of performing temporally extended objectives
  given at runtime, done by pretraining and freezing automata embeddings prior to
  training the downstream policy. However, no theoretical guarantees were given. This
  work provides a theoretical framework for the automata-conditioned RL problem and
  shows that it is probably approximately correct (PAC) learnable. We then present
  a technique for learning provably correct automata embeddings, guaranteeing optimal
  multi-task policy learning. Our experimental evaluation confirms these theoretical
  results.
