title: Knowledge-Enriched Machine Learning for Tabular Data
abstract: In this paper, we introduce the general framework of knowledge-enriched
  machine learning for encoding and leveraging problem-specific deterministic knowledge,
  such as column descriptions in the tabular setting. We focus on supervised learning
  problems on tabular data and present a flexible encoding of such deterministic information
  in the form of concept kernels. We describe meta-algorithms which leverage this
  encoding and introduce KE-TALENT, a benchmarking suite adapted from TALENT to include
  concept kernels and metadata for each dataset. Experimental results on kernel-enriched
  versions of existing algorithms demonstrate improved performance, establishing baselines
  and grounding future research. Code is publicly available.
