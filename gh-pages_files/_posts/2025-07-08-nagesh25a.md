title: Taylor-Model Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for Ordinary Differential
  Equations
abstract: 'We study the problem of learning neural network models for Ordinary Differential
  Equations (ODEs) with parametric uncertainties. Such neural network models capture
  the solution to the ODE over a given set of parameters, initial conditions, and
  range of times. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising
  approach for learning such models that combine data-driven deep learning with symbolic
  physics models in a principled manner. However, the accuracy of PINNs degrade when
  they are used to solve an entire family of initial value problems characterized
  by varying parameters and initial conditions. In this paper, we combine symbolic
  differentiation and Taylor series methods to propose a class of higher-order models
  for capturing the solutions to ODEs. These models combine neural networks and symbolic
  terms: they use higher order Lie derivatives and a Taylor series expansion obtained
  symbolically, with the remainder term modeled as a neural network. The key insight
  is that the remainder term can itself be modeled as a solution to a first-order
  ODE. We show how the use of these higher order PINNs can improve accuracy using
  interesting, but challenging ODE benchmarks. We also show that the resulting model
  can be quite useful for situations such as controlling uncertain physical systems
  modeled as ODEs.'
