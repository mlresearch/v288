title: 'KGAccel: A Domain-Specific Reconfigurable Accelerator for Knowledge Graph
  Reasoning'
abstract: Recent hardware accelerators for graph learning have largely overlooked
  knowledge graph reasoning (KGR), which demands more complex models and longer training
  times than typical graph tasks. Existing approaches rely on single or distributed
  GPUs to accelerate translational embedding models, but these general-purpose solutions
  lag in handling reinforcement learning-based KGR. To address this gap, we introduce
  KGAccel, the first domain-specific accelerator for RL-based KGR on FPGA. We develop
  a knowledge-graph compression method and propose a resource-aware mechanism that
  enables high-speed training even on smaller FPGAs. KGAccel achieves up to 65x speedup
  over CPU, 8x over GPU, and over 30x higher energy efficiency.
