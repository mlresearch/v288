title: Efficient Neuro-Symbolic Policy using In-Memory Computing
abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) systems grow in complexity, achieving computationally
  efficient and interpretable decision-making is crucial. Neuro-Symbolic AI (NeSy)
  offers a promising framework by integrating symbolic representation with neural
  learning, but its execution on traditional hardware remains inefficient due to memory
  bottlenecks and high computational costs. This paper advocates for a paradigm shift
  in AI acceleration—moving beyond traditional von Neumann architectures toward memory-centric
  computation, unlocking real-time, scalable, and interpretable decision-making for
  next-generation AI applications. We envision a future where In-Memory Computing
  (IMC)-based acceleration fundamentally transforms Neuro-Symbolic policy acceleration
  by mapping it onto hardware-associative memory, enabling O(1) complexity decision-making
  with drastically reduced energy consumption and latency. Our preliminary results
  show that IMC-based symbolic policies achieve up to 100x speedup and six orders
  of magnitude better energy efficiency than CPU and GPU implementations. Moreover,
  we discuss how probabilistic symbolic policies can be realized within IMC architectures,
  enabling AI systems to handle uncertainty while maintaining efficiency.
