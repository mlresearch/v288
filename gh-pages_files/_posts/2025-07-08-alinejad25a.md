title: Bidirectional End-to-End Framework for Transfer from Abstract Models in Non-Markovian
  Reinforcement Learning
abstract: We propose a bidirectional end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) framework
  for solving complex non-Markovian tasks in discrete and continuous environments.
  Instead of directly learning policies in high-dimensional spaces, we first construct
  a simplified teacher model as a surrogate environment from offline trajectories.
  Simultaneously, we infer a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) using the RPNI algorithm
  to capture task dependencies. A policy is learned in the surrogate environment and
  transferred to the original domain via automaton distillation, which guides policy
  learning more effectively than direct RL in the original environment. Our framework
  integrates DQN for discrete tasks and DDPG/TD3 for continuous settings. Empirical
  results demonstrate that this structured transfer significantly improves learning
  efficiency and convergence speed, outperforming standard RL baselines.
