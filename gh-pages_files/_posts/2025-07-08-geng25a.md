title: Learning Minimal Neural Specifications
abstract: 'Formal verification is only as good as the specification of a system, which
  is also true for neural network verification. Existing specifications follow the
  paradigm of data as specification, where the local neighborhood around a reference
  data point is considered correct or robust. While these specifications provide a
  fair testbed for assessing model robustness, they are too restrictive for verifying
  any unseen test data points—a challenging task with significant real-world implications.
  Recent work shows great promise through a new paradigm, neural representation as
  specification, which uses neural activation patterns (NAPs) for this purpose. However,
  it computes the most refined NAPs, which include many redundant neurons. In this
  paper, we study the following problem: Given a neural network, find a minimal (general)
  NAP specification that is sufficient for formal verification of its robustness properties.
  Finding the minimal NAP specification not only expands verifiable bounds but also
  provides insights into which set of neurons contributes to the model’s robustness.
  To address this problem, we propose three approaches: conservative, statistical,
  and optimistic. Each of these methods offers distinct strengths and trade-offs in
  terms of minimality and computational speed, making them suitable for scenarios
  with different priorities. Notably, the optimistic approach can probe potential
  causal links between neurons and the robustness of large vision neural networks
  without relying on verification tools—a task existing methods struggle to scale.
  Our experiments show that minimal NAP specifications use far fewer neurons than
  those from previous work while expanding verifiable boundaries by several orders
  of magnitude.'
