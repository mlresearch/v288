title: Learning Formal Specifications from Membership and Preference Queries
abstract: Active learning is a well-studied approach to learning formal specifications,
  such as automata. In this work, we extend active specification learning by proposing
  a novel framework that strategically requests a combination of membership labels
  and pair-wise preferences, a popular alternative to membership labels. We formalize
  the notion of using preference queries in the context of specification learning
  by introducing Membership Respecting Preferences (MemRePs), a class of pair-wise
  preferences that can be used in conjunction with membership queries. The combination
  of pair-wise preferences and membership labels allows for a more flexible approach
  to active specification learning, often reducing the number of membership queries
  required to learn specifications. We instantiate our framework for two different
  classes of specifications, demonstrating the generality of our approach. Our results
  suggest that learning from both modalities allows us to robustly and conveniently
  identify specifications via membership and preferences.
