title: 'Taxonomic Networks: A Representation for Neuro-Symbolic Pairing'
abstract: We introduce the concept of a neuro-symbolic pairâ€”neural and symbolic approaches
  that are linked through a common knowledge representation. Next, we present taxonomic
  networks, a type of discrimination network in which nodes represent hierarchically
  organized taxonomic concepts. Using this representation, we construct a novel neuro-symbolic
  pair and evaluate its performance. We show that our symbolic method learns taxonomic
  nets more efficiently with less data and compute, while the neural method finds
  higher-accuracy taxonomic nets when provided with greater resources. As a neuro-symbolic
  pair, these approaches can be used interchangeably based on situational needs, with
  seamless translation between them when necessary. This work lays the foundation
  for future systems that more fundamentally integrate neural and symbolic computation.
