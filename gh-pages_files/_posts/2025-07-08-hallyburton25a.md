title: Assured Autonomy with Neuro-Symbolic Perception
abstract: Many state-of-the-art AI models deployed in cyber-physical systems (CPS),
  while highly accurate, are simply pattern-matchers. With limited security guarantees,
  there are concerns for their reliability in safety-critical and contested domains.
  To advance assured AI, we advocate for a paradigm shift that imbues data-driven
  perception models with symbolic structure, inspired by a humanâ€™s ability to reason
  over low-level features and high-level context. We propose a neuro-symbolic paradigm
  for perception (NeuSPaPer) and illustrate how joint object detection and scene graph
  generation (SGG) yields deep scene understanding. Powered by foundation models for
  offline knowledge extraction and specialized SGG algorithms for real-time deployment,
  we design a framework leveraging structured relational graphs that ensures the integrity
  of situational awareness in autonomy. Using physics-based simulators and real-world
  datasets, we demonstrate how SGG bridges the gap between low-level sensor perception
  and high-level reasoning, establishing a foundation for resilient, context-aware
  AI and advancing trusted autonomy in CPS.
