title: 'A Tutorial on Neural Network-Based Solvers for Hyperbolic Conservation Laws:
  Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning, and Applications to Traffic Modeling'
abstract: Neural networks (NNs) are powerful tools for solving complex partial differential
  equations (PDEs) with high accuracy. However, many NN-based solvers are designed
  as general-purpose models or lack theoretical grounding, limiting their ability
  to capture essential solution properties such as regularity, conservation, and entropy
  conditions. This issue is especially critical for hyperbolic conservation laws,
  which govern wave propagation and shock formation, and are among the most challenging
  PDEs to solve accurately. This tutorial examines both supervised and unsupervised
  NN-based solvers from computational and theoretical perspectives, with a focus on
  NN-based finite volume methods (FVMs) tailored to conservation laws. In the supervised
  setting, NN solvers learn from available solution data, such as Riemann problems,
  to capture characteristic solution structures, while the unsupervised approach employs
  a weak formulation loss to enforce the correct weak solution behavior. In practice,
  both the supervised and unsupervised variants tend to learn the entropic solution,
  effectively handling discontinuities and shocks, and outperforming comparable numerical
  schemes in accuracy. This tutorial aims to provide a deeper understanding of NN-based
  solvers for PDEs and to present structure-preserving neural methods for scientific
  computing.
