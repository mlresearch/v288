title: State-Dependent Conformal Perception Bounds for Neuro-Symbolic Verification
  of Autonomous Systems
abstract: It remains a challenge to provide safety guarantees for autonomous systems
  with neural perception and control. A typical approach obtains symbolic bounds on
  perception error (e.g., using conformal prediction) and performs verification under
  these bounds. However, these bounds can lead to drastic conservatism in the resulting
  end-to-end safety guarantee. This paper proposes an approach to synthesize symbolic
  perception error bounds that serve as an optimal interface between perception performance
  and control verification. The key idea is to consider our error bounds to be heteroskedastic
  with respect to the system’s state — not time like in previous approaches. These
  bounds can be obtained with two gradient-free optimization algorithms. We demonstrate
  that our bounds lead to tighter safety guarantees than the state-of-the-art in a
  case study on a mountain car.
