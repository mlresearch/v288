title: Real-Time Reachability for Neurosymbolic Reinforcement Learning-based Safe
  Autonomous Navigation
abstract: 'Safety is essential in autonomous navigation, especially as autonomous
  systems deploy to new environments where collision avoidance is critical. Neurosymbolic
  reinforcement learning (NeSy RL) approaches show promise for advancing long-term
  navigation by using symbolic planners to compute high-level waypoints and goal-conditioned
  RL for low-level control. However, ensuring safety within these frameworks remains
  a challenge, particularly in new environments that the agent was not optimized for.
  Current safe RL-based navigation techniques offer robust frameworks for ensuring
  safety. However, these approaches are not adapted for NeSy RL and also present challenges:
  they can be computationally intensive or constrained by conservative control. To
  overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach to safely and efficiently
  navigate a NeSy RL agent in new environments. The proposed method uses real-time
  reachability analysis to select subgoals between waypoints and safeguard the actions
  of a goal-conditioned RL policy. We implement the approach in Rust and develop a
  software package, RusTReach, for real-time reachability analysis. We deploy our
  approach on an embedded device and compare against four approaches in a long-term
  quadcopter navigation task in a new environment. Our evaluation reveals that our
  approach is at least 1.7 times faster at navigating than a state-of-the-art alternative
  while maintaining safety and real-time constraint compliance. Code and videos available
