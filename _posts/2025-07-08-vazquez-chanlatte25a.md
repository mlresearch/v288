title: 'L*LM: Learning Automata from Demonstrations, Examples, and Natural Language'
abstract: Expert demonstrations have proven to be an easy way to indirectly specify
  complex tasks. Recent algorithms even support extracting unambiguous formal specifications,
  e.g. deterministic finite automata (DFA), from demonstrations. Unfortunately, these
  techniques are typically not sample-efficient. In this work, we introduce L*LM,
  an algorithm for learning DFAs from both demonstrations and natural language. Due
  to the expressivity of natural language, we observe a significant improvement in
  the data efficiency of learning DFAs from expert demonstrations. Technically, L*LM
  leverages large language models to answer membership queries about the underlying
  task. This is then combined with recent techniques for transforming learning from
  demonstrations into a sequence of labeled example learning problems. In our experiments,
  we observe the two modalities complement each other, yielding a powerful few-shot
  learner.
