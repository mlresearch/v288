title: Stochastic Neural Simulation Relations for Control Transfer
abstract: This paper explores a neurosymbolic approach to probabilistic transfer of
  control logic from a source stochastic control system to a target system while ensuring
  approximately equivalent behavioral guarantees in both domains. Traditional methods
  struggle with this problem due to the absence of a complete characterization of
  behavioral specifications, which prevents a direct formulation in terms of loss
  functions. To address this challenge, we leverage the concept of stochastic simulation
  relations to establish probabilistic observational equivalence between the behaviors
  of two (black-box) stochastic systems. These functions ensure that the outputs of
  both systems, equipped with their respective controllers, remain probabilistically
  close over time. By parameterizing stochastic simulation functions with neural networks,
  we introduce the notion of stochastic neural simulation functions, enabling a data-driven
  mechanism to transfer any synthesized controller—along with its proof of correctness—without
  requiring explicit specification of behavioral constraints. This neurosymbolic integration
  combines the scalability of neural methods with the formal guarantees of symbolic
  approaches, bridging the gap between learning-based control synthesis and formal
  verification. Compared to prior methods, our approach eliminates the need for a
  closed-loop mathematical model and explicit requirement specifications for both
  the source and target systems, while providing probabilistic guarantees over an
  infinite horizon. We also introduce validity conditions that, when satisfied, ensure
  the closeness of the outputs of two systems equipped with their corresponding controllers,
  removing the need for post-facto verification. We demonstrate the effectiveness
  of our approach through four case studies, highlighting its potential to advance
  scalable, formally grounded, and transferable control synthesis.
