title: Differentiable Synthesis of Behavior Tree Architectures and Execution Nodes
abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success in solving
  complex control tasks. However, neural network policies often lack interpretability
  and struggle to generalize to new scenarios without further training. Behavior trees
  (BTs) offer a more interpretable policy representation, making them a promising
  alternative. Yet, the automatic synthesis of BTs remains a challenge due to the
  discrete search space and the need to adapt to diverse scenarios. Prior works often
  come at the cost of fixed or constrained architectures, or rely on customized execution
  nodes. We propose an end-to-end synthesis framework that simultaneously generates
  the architectures and execution nodes of BTs solely from environment rewards. We
  first conduct architecture search on top of a continuous relaxation of the architecture
  search space derived from a given grammar. To tackle the discrete execution mechanism
  and non-differentiable semantics of BTs, we redefine the execution mechanism and
  interpret the semantics in terms of a differentiable approximation. We also propose
  an efficient extraction algorithm that leverages the fallback structure of BTs to
  instantiate a valid BT architecture. This algorithm recovers the performance damaged
  by the co-adaptation and continuous approximation. Experimental results show the
  superior performance and generalization of our synthesized BTs, demonstrating the
  efficacy of the proposed framework.
