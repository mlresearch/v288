title: 'ChatHTN: Interleaving Approximate (LLM) and Symbolic HTN Planning'
abstract: We introduce ChatHTN, a Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planner that combines
  symbolic HTN planning techniques with queries to ChatGPT to approximate solutions
  in the form of task decompositions. The resulting hierarchies interleave task decompositions
  generated by symbolic HTN planning with those generated by ChatGPT. Despite the
  approximate nature of the results generated by ChatGPT, ChatHTN is provably sound;
  any plan it generates correctly achieves the input tasks. We demonstrate this property
  with an open-source implementation of our system.
