title: Neuro-Symbolic Generative Diffusion Models for Physically Grounded, Robust,
  and Safe Generation
abstract: 'Despite the remarkable generative capabilities of diffusion models, their
  integration into safety-critical or scientifically rigorous applications remains
  hindered by the need to ensure compliance with stringent physical, structural, and
  operational constraints. To address this challenge, this paper introduces Neuro-Symbolic
  Diffusion (NSD), a novel framework that interleaves diffusion steps with symbolic
  optimization, enabling the generation of certifiably consistent samples under user-defined
  functional and logic constraints. This key feature is provided for both standard
  and discrete diffusion models, enabling, for the first time, the generation of both
  continuous (e.g., images and trajectories) and discrete (e.g., molecular structures
  and natural language) outputs that comply with constraints. This ability is demonstrated
  on tasks spanning three key challenges: (1) Safety, in the context of non-toxic
  molecular generation and collision-free trajectory optimization; (2) Data scarcity,
  in domains such as drug discovery and materials engineering; and (3) Out-of-domain
  generalization, where enforcing symbolic constraints allows adaptation beyond the
  training distribution.'
