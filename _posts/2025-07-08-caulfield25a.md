title: Modularity in Query-Based Concept Learning
abstract: We define and study the problem of modular concept learning, which is learning
  a concept that is a cross-product (i.e., Cartesian product) of component concepts.
  The theory of concept learning provides a framework for analyzing algorithms for
  inductive synthesis of programs and systems, which involves synthesis from examples
  and queries. Modular concept learning is important for systems that can be broken
  into subsystems that each act independently of the other. We analyze this problem
  with respect to different types of queries that are made to an oracle, formalized
  as an oracle interface. We show that if a given oracle interface cannot directly
  answer questions about the components, learning can be difficult, even when the
  components are easy to learn with the same type of oracle queries. Specifically,
  we show that learning from membership, equivalence, or subset queries is hard. However,
  these problems become tractable when oracles are given a positive example and are
  allowed to ask membership queries.
