title: Formal Synthesis of Lyapunov Stability Certificates for Linear Switched Systems
  using ReLU Neural Networks
abstract: 'This paper presents a neural network-based algorithm with soundness guarantees
  to study the stability of discrete-time linear switched systems. This algorithm
  follows a counterexample guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS) architecture: an iterative
  process alternating between the learner, which provides a candidate Lyapunov function,
  and the verifier which checks its validity over the whole domain. We choose a ReLU
  neural network as learner for its expressivity and flexibility, and a satisfiability
  module theories (SMT) solver as verifier. In addition, we introduce a post processing
  step to leverage a valid Lyapunov function from the neural network in case of failure
  of the CEGIS loop. Several examples demonstrate the algorithmâ€™s efficacy.'
