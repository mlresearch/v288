title: Neuro-Symbolic Behavior Trees (NSBTs) and Their Verification
abstract: Neural networks have proven to be incredibly powerful and useful in a variety
  of domains, but are also often opaque and difficult to reason about. This is undesirable
  in safety-critical systems. An approach to help mitigate this is to utilize a neuro-symbolic
  approach that combines the power of neural networks and symbolic structures. In
  this paper, we present Neuro-Symbolic Behavior Trees (NSBTs). NSBTs are behavior
  trees that utilize neural networks. We provide several examples of NSBTs, including
  grid-world examples and a representation of a portion of ACAS Xu, an aircraft collision
  avoidance system. The grid world example considers over 6 million input states for
  the neural network, while the ACAS Xu example features 5 networks, each with 6 layers
  of 50 neurons. Additionally, we implemented support for NSBTs in our BehaVerify
  software tool, and verify certain safety and liveness properties for these NSBTs.
  Our verification approach also demonstrates how future improvements could be made
  using existing neural network verification techniques.
