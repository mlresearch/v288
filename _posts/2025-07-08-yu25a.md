title: Learning Subject to Constraints via Abstract Gradient Descent
abstract: Deep learning has made significant advancements and has been successfully
  used in different areas. However, current deep learning models are based on theories
  of probability and statistics, thus suffer from adhering to constraints and ensuring
  assurances. In contrast, symbolic methods inherently own rigidity but with low efficiency
  and high cost. In this paper, we propose a novel symbolic learning architecture
  which can deal with data fitting and logic satisfaction uniformly. The key idea
  is to treat logic formulas as discrete functions that can be optimized through Abstract
  Gradient Descent, a discrete optimization method based on backward abstract interpretation.
  The efficiency of our approach is illustrated by training a symbolic neural network
  with 8,542 parameters that can accurately recognize 70,000 handwritten digits. Experiments
  indicate that the trained model not only fits the data well but also adheres to
  key properties such as robustness, invariance to zooming, translation, resistance
  to noise background, and so on.
