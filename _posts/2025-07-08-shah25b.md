title: A Challenge to Build Neuro-Symbolic Video Agents
abstract: 'Modern video understanding systems excel at tasks such as scene classification,
  object detection, and short video retrieval. However, as video analysis becomes
  increasingly central to real-world applications, there is a growing need for proactive
  video agents—systems that not only interpret video streams but also reason about
  events and take informed actions. A key obstacle in this direction is temporal reasoning:
  while deep learning models have made remarkable progress in recognizing patterns
  within individual frames or short clips, they struggle to understand the sequencing
  and dependencies of events over time, which is critical for action-driven decision-making.
  Addressing this limitation demands moving beyond conventional deep learning approaches.
  We posit that tackling this challenge requires a neuro-symbolic perspective, where
  video queries are decomposed into atomic events, structured into coherent sequences,
  and validated against temporal constraints. Such an approach can enhance interpretability,
  enable structured reasoning, and provide stronger guarantees on system behavior,
  all key properties for advancing trustworthy video agents. To this end, we present
  a grand challenge to the research community: developing the next generation of intelligent
  video agents that integrate three core capabilities—(1) autonomous video search
  and analysis, (2) seamless real-world interaction, and (3) advanced content generation.
  By addressing these pillars, we can transition from passive perception to intelligent
  video agents that reason, predict, and act, pushing the boundaries of video understanding.'
