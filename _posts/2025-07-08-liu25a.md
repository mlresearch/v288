title: Interpretable Imitation Learning via Generative Adversarial STL Inference and
  Control
abstract: Imitation learning methods have demonstrated considerable success in teaching
  autonomous systems complex tasks through expert demonstrations. However, a limitation
  of these methods is their lack of interpretability, particularly in understanding
  the specific task the learning agent aims to accomplish. In this paper, we propose
  a novel imitation learning method that combines Signal Temporal Logic (STL) inference
  and control synthesis, enabling the explicit representation of the task as an STL
  formula. This approach not only provides a clear understanding of the task but also
  supports the integration of human knowledge and allows for adaptation to out-of-distribution
  scenarios by manually adjusting the STL formulas and fine-tuning the policy. We
  employ a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-inspired approach to train both the
  inference and policy networks, effectively narrowing the gap between expert and
  learned policies. The efficiency of our algorithm is demonstrated through simulations,
  showcasing its practical applicability and adaptability.
