title: 'Why Neural Networks Can Discover Symbolic Structures with Gradient-based Training:
  An Algebraic and Geometric Foundation for Neurosymbolic Reasoning'
abstract: 'We develop a theoretical framework that explains how discrete symbolic
  structures can emerge naturally from continuous neural network training dynamics.
  By lifting neural parameters to a measure space and modeling training as Wasserstein
  gradient flow, we show that under geometric constraints, such as group invariance,
  the parameter measure $\mu_t$ undergoes two concurrent phenomena: (1) a decoupling
  of the gradient flow into independent optimization trajectories over some potential
  functions, and (2) a progressive contraction on the degree of freedom. These potentials
  encode algebraic constraints relevant to the task and act as ring homomorphisms
  under a commutative semi-ring structure on the measure space. As training progresses,
  the network transitions from a high-dimensional exploration to compositional representations
  that comply with algebraic operations and exhibit a lower degree of freedom. We
  further establish data scaling laws for realizing symbolic tasks, linking representational
  capacity to the group invariance that facilitates symbolic solutions. This framework
  charts a principled foundation for understanding and designing neurosymbolic systems
  that integrate continuous learning with discrete algebraic reasoning'
