title: 'Efficient Processing of Neuro-Symbolic AI: A Tutorial and Cross-Layer Co-Design
  Case Study'
abstract: 'While neural-based models have driven recent breakthroughs in artificial
  intelligence (AI), they face critical challenges in unsustainable computational
  demands, limited robustness, and lack of interpretability. Neuro-symbolic (NeSy)
  AI has emerged as a promising paradigm that integrates neural learning and symbolic
  reasoning to enhance explainability, robustness, and data efficiency. Recent NeSy
  systems demonstrated strong potential in reasoning and trustworthy decision-making
  tasks, making them particularly suitable for cognitive human-AI applications. This
  tutorial presents a vertically integrated approach on the efficient processing of
  NeSy AI, bridging workload characteristics with system and hardware co-design. We
  begin by systematically categorizing NeSy workloads and analyzing their computational
  and memory demands to expose performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.
  Building on these insights, we focus on a class of vector-symbolic architecture-based
  NeSy systems and present a series of hardware case studies, including processing
  element microarchitecture, dataflow, FPGA design, and system-on-chip prototype.
  Our results highlight the efficiency and scalability improvements of NeSy systems,
  with the integration of application discovery, systems thinking, and co-design intelligence.
