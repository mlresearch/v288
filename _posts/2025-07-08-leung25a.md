title: 'From Road to Code: Neuro-Symbolic Program Synthesis for Autonomous Driving
  Scene Translation and Analysis'
abstract: Translating real-world scenarios into simulation environments is essential
  for the safe, cost-effective, and scalable development of autonomous vehicles. Simulations
  enable rigorous testing of complex, rare, and hazardous scenarios, while also allowing
  for rapid iteration, data generation, and exposure to diverse conditions. However,
  the real-to-sim gap remains a significant challenge, as automated methods often
  fail to accurately capture real-world conditions, and manual scenario generation
  is labor-intensive and struggles to replicate realistic dynamics and unpredictable
  human behavior. In this work, we propose Road2Code, a framework that bridges the
  gap between real-world traffic data and simulation by leveraging neuro-symbolic
  program synthesis. Road2Code translates real-world driving scenarios into Scenic
  programs for the CARLA simulator, utilizing large language models for code generation.
  To enhance efficiency, we employ a distillation approach, where a large language
  teacher model generates reasoning processes that refine training for a smaller student
  model used for inference. Road2Code enhances simulation fidelity by accurately modeling
  real-world scenarios and agent behaviors, while enabling scenario editing and counterfactual
  analysis, providing essential tools for testing and refining autonomous vehicle
  behavior. This direct link between real-world data and simulation lays a foundation
  for advancing trustworthy and transparent autonomous driving research, accelerating
  progress toward reliable autonomous vehicle systems.
