title: 'PCA-DDReach: Efficient Statistical Reachability Analysis of Stochastic Dynamical
  Systems via Principal Component Analysis'
abstract: This paper proposes a scalable data-driven algorithm for reachability analysis
  of complex cyber-physical systems (CPS) without requiring parametric models. Traditional
  methods rely on known physical dynamics, which are often unavailable due to system
  complexity or variability. Instead, we treat such systems as black boxes and use
  trajectory data to learn predictive models. To quantify prediction uncertainty and
  ensure safety, we integrate conformal inference (CI) — a statistical tool for probabilistic
  guarantees — with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce conservatism and
  enhance scalability. Our method constructs probabilistic reachable sets that are
  less conservative under distribution shifts compared to prior CI-based methods.
  We validate the approach on high-dimensional systems, including a 12D quadcopter
  and a 27D powertrain model, demonstrating improved accuracy and computational efficiency
  over existing techniques.
